abstract = {Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) may not provide insight into the "state of the practice" in SE, as they do not typically include the "grey" (non-published) literature. A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a SLR which includes grey literature in addition to the published (formal) literature. Only a few MLRs have been published in SE so far. We aim at raising the awareness for MLRs in SE by addressing two research questions (RQs): (1) What types of knowledge are missed when a SLR does not include the multivocal literature in a SE field? and (2) What do we, as a community, gain when we include the multivocal literature and conduct MLRs? To answer these RQs, we sample a few example SLRs and MLRs and identify the missing and the gained knowledge due to excluding or including the grey literature. We find that (1) grey literature can give substantial benefits in certain areas of SE, and that (2) the inclusion of grey literature brings forward certain challenges as evidence in them is often experience and opinion based. Given these conflicting viewpoints, the authors are planning to prepare systematic guidelines for performing MLRs in SE.},

Being a formalized collection of knowledge rather than a physical artifact, software allows shortcuts in its development process. The shortcuts serve various purposes, like releasing a product to the market faster or postponing the solution of a problem. In this article, we present the findings of an investigation of workarounds in two software companies. Our analysis reveals that the decisions to take a workaround to resolve a technical issue are often intentional and forced by time-to-market requirements. However, the stakeholders are not always familiar with the negative consequences of taking workarounds, like additional hours, costs, and poor quality. We argue that the decision to take a workaround is often made by business managers who see short-term benefits only while developers have to deal with negative consequences in long-term.",

 abstract = {This article aims to stimulate discussion about the issue of rigor in conducting reviews of multivocal literatures. Multivocal literatures, which abound in the field of education, are comprised of all accessible writings on a common, often contemporary topic. The exploratory case study method is proposed as a means to engender rigor in reviews of such literatures. It is argued that it is appropriate to apply the concept of rigor to reviews of multivocal literatures and to use the exploratory case study method as a tool for thinking about procedures that could enhance rigor in such reviews. The article draws upon the authors' experiences in conducting a review of the literature on school-based management to illustrate how the proposed procedures might be employed.},

abstract = {Context
Many researchers adopting systematic reviews (SRs) have also published papers discussing problems with the SR methodology and suggestions for improving it. Since guidelines for SRs in software engineering (SE) were last updated in 2007, we believe it is time to investigate whether the guidelines need to be amended in the light of recent research.
Objective
To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process.
Method
We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the SR process. Studies were classified with respect to the stage in the SR process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools.
Results
We identified 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difficult.
Conclusion
We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would benefit from tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical methods remains a major problem.}

This talk aims at sharing what we learned from different types of SMEs (from startups to grownups, both IT and non IT) about common problems gathered in a long term survey. We then focus on key issues like requirements, technical debt, test/release and (agile/lean) project management.

abstract = {Context: Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor used to describe outstanding software maintenance tasks or shortcuts made in the software development to achieve short-term benefits (i.e. time to market), but negatively impact the software quality in the long term. TD is quite common in a software startup, which is characterized as a young company with low resources and a small client base, aiming to accelerate time to market. Decisions related to TD can be critical for startup success. Objective: I aim to understand the relationship between TD decisions and the success or failure of software startups, and explore the best practices related to TD decisions that would better contribute to the startup success. Method: I plan to apply multiple retrospective case studies in different software startups that succeed or failed to pass the startup period and become a mature organization. Semi structured interviews will be used to collect data from the team who was involved in the software development in the startup era. Contribution: The outcome of this study will help software founders/entrepreneurs to make effective TD decisions during the startup timeframe; that can better contribute to the startup success and decrease the risk of the startup failure.},

abstract = {Nowadays, industrial research labs operate like startups. In a relatively short amount of time, researchers are expected not only to explore innovative ideas but also show how the new ideas can add value to the organisation. One way to do this, especially when developing tools, is to construct usable prototypes. When the technology underlying the research tool is highly complex or niche, like program analysis, field trials with potential users also help explaining and demonstrating the benefits of the tool. Getting support from potential users helps demonstrate value to the organisation, which in turn justifies conducting more extensive research and investing more resources to enhance the initial prototype.Thus, research that involves the construction of tools need to manage both short and long term risk, and the technical debt that arises throughout the lifecycle of a research prototype. As not all prototypes will result in a technology transfer, one has to carefully manage the project resources dedicated to paying the technical debt. For example, failure to pay the debt early in the project might result in unstable prototypes that can have a negative influence on potential customers and make technology transfer harder. On the other hand, over committing resources to reduce the technical debt might result in slower research progress and failure to show improvement over state-of-the-art. In this paper, we will present experience reports from two dynamic program analysis projects. at Oracle Labs Australia.},

abstract = {Context: Software start-ups are young companies aiming to build and market software-intensive products fast with little resources. Aiming to accelerate time-to-market, start-ups often opt for ad-hoc engineering practices, make shortcuts in product engineering, and accumulate technical debt.Objective: In this paper we explore to what extent precedents, dimensions and outcomes associated with technical debt are prevalent in start-ups.Method: We apply a case survey method to identify aspects of technical debt and contextual information characterizing the engineering context in start-ups.Results: By analyzing responses from 86 start-up cases we found that start-ups accumulate most technical debt in the testing dimension, despite attempts to automate testing. Furthermore, we found that start-up team size and experience is a leading precedent for accumulating technical debt: larger teams face more challenges in keeping the debt under control.Conclusions: This study highlights the necessity to monitor levels of technical debt and to preemptively introduce practices to keep the debt under control. Adding more people to an already difficult to maintain product could amplify other precedents, such as resource shortages, communication issues and negatively affect decisions pertaining to the use of good engineering practices.},

abstract = {Software start-ups face fierce competition in the market forcing them to release their products quickly and often under tough time constraints. To meet their deadlines, start-ups take shortcuts in software development leading to the accumulation of technical debt. They are able to put their product in users hands faster, get feedback, and improve at the expense of quality issues in the long run. As a start-up evolves through inception, stabilization and growth this debt will have to be managed. Technical debt management and software product line engineering techniques have some similar benefits of increased productivity and reduced time-to-market. Our aim is to check whether software product line engineering can be a candidate technique for start-ups to employ in managing technical debt as a response to their life-cycle phase goals and challenges. We conducted expert interviews with nine start-up professionals to identify the strategies applied in relation to technical debt management and software product lines engineering and other software engineering practices in start-ups. By analyzing the responses from the interviews we found that depending on the life-cycle phase of the start-up software product line engineering proved effective in managing technical debt and helped the start-ups to advance through the life-cycle phases.},

abstract="Software startups are newly created companies with little operating history and oriented towards producing cutting-edge products. As their time and resources are extremely scarce, and one failed project can put them out of business, startups need effective practices to face with those unique challenges. However, only few scientific studies attempt to address characteristics of failure, especially during the early-stage. With this study we aim to raise our understanding of the failure of early-stage software startup companies. This state-of-practice investigation was performed using a literature review followed by a multiple-case study approach. The results present how inconsistency between managerial strategies and execution can lead to failure by means of a behavioral framework. Despite strategies reveal the first need to understand the problem/solution fit, actual executions prioritize the development of the product to launch on the market as quickly as possible to verify product/market fit, neglecting the necessary learning process.",

abstract = "Context: Software startups aim to develop innovative products, grow rapidly, and thus become important in the development of economy and jobs. Requirements engineering (RE) is a key process area in software development, but its effects on software startups are unclear. Objective: The main objective of this study was to explore how RE (elicitation, documentation, prioritization and validation) is used in software startups. Method: A multi-vocal literature review (MLR) was used to find scientific and gray literature. In addition, a case survey was employed to gather empirical data to reach this study’s objective. Results: In the MLR, 36 primary articles were selected out of 28,643 articles. In the case survey, 80 respondents provided information about software startup cases across the globe. Data analysis revealed that during RE processes, internal sources (e.g., for source), analyses of similar products (e.g., elicitation), uses of informal notes (e.g., for documentation), values to customers, products and stakeholders (e.g., for prioritization) and internal reviews/prototypes (e.g., for validation) were the most used techniques. Conclusion: After an analysis of primary literature, it was concluded that research on this topic is still in early stages and more systematic research is needed. Furthermore, few topics were suggested for future research."

In this study, we focus on exploring the key challenges that early-stage software startups have to cope with from idea conceptualization to the first time to market. To investigate the key challenges, we used a mixed-method research approach which includes both a large-scale survey of 5389 responses and an in-depth multiple-case study. The initial findings reveal that thriving in technology uncertainty and acquiring the first paying customer are among the top challenges, perceived and experienced by early-stage software startups.

abstract="Expert interviews are a good example of the way in which the everyday practice of social research and theoretical consideration of this practice do not always run parallel to one another. The use of particular methods sometimes precedes their general theoretical reflection. For many years, the widely held view was that expert interviews were conducted frequently but only rarely thought through (Meuser and Nagel, 1991). Only in recent years has the debate about expert interviews gradually become more concrete (see Bogner and Menz, 2008). However, this has certainly not led to a situation in which the different definitions and methodological conceptions of expert interviews have moved closer together. Even today there are disputes not only about how expert interviews can be placed on a secure methodological footing, but also about whether this is even possible in principle.",

Startups that lack necessary competences often seek for external resources from outsourcing partners. Little is known how this outsourcing relationship works and whether it makes sense to outsource the technical competence to an external party. This is among the first investigations on the outsourcing relationships in software startups. By conducting exploratory case studies at six startups, we found a mixed experience with outsourcing. The experimental nature of an early product development makes outsourcing a feasible option, although startups often suffer from its uncertainty and managing commitments from partners. Results further propose that early contract-based activities could be transformed into a long-term partnership by adopting a startup boundary spanner's role, establishing an inter-personal relationship and maintaining a mutual commitment.1},

The current understanding of the challenges that software startups may encounter is very limited. In this paper, we use the research framework of learning and product development stages to analyse the key challenges that software startups have to deal with at different life cycle stages, from problem definition to solution validation and from concept to mature product. Based on an analysis of the empirical data collected by a large survey of 4100 startups, we find out that what perceived as biggest challenges by software startups do vary across different life cycle stages. Building product is the biggest obstacle for software startups, even though its significance decreases when the learning focuses of the startups move from problem to solution and their products mature. Business related challenges such as customer acquisition and scaling are more noticeable at the later stages. Our study raises the awareness of these challenges and suggests to tackle right challenges at the right time.",

	Very little is known about the engineering context in start-up companies. On the surface, start-ups are characterized by uncertainty, high risk and minimal resources. However, such characterization is not granular enough to support identification of specific engineering challenges and to devise start-up specific engineering practices.
	The first step towards understanding on software engineering in start-ups is definition of the Start-up Context Map - a taxonomy of engineering practices, environment factors and goals influencing the engineering process. Goal of the Start-up Context Map is to support further research on the field and to serve as an engineering decision support tool for start-ups. },

A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations.}

abstract = {Startups arise in environments of extreme uncertainty, with few resources and the need to scale quickly. In the growth phase, they still need agility, but they tend to concern more with software quality and the development process by having more human and financial resources. Studying the factors that lead startups in the growth phase to seek quality in their processes can help new startups anticipate implementing quality practices. In this paper, we aim to identify how startups adopt quality practices in the growth phase. We carried out a multiple case study with four growth phase startups. We applied qualitative analysis techniques to summarize the findings. The studied startups adopt limited quality practices and are influenced by the development team's maturity level, organizational culture, and experience. Furthermore, they tend to be reactive towards quality, solving the problems when they impact their product, business, customer, or when technical debt can no longer be managed. The findings are relevant to support stabilizing and growing startups to define actions to improve the quality of their processes and products. Besides, they suggest that growth phase startups begin a process of change in the organizational culture concerning quality, adopting the behavior of mature companies as soon as they get more human and financial resources.},

	abstract="Software startups operate under various uncertainties and the demand on their ability to deal with change is high. Agile methods are considered a suitable and viable development approach for them. However, the competing needs for speed and quality may render certain agile practices less suitable than others in the startup context. The adoption of agile practices can be further complicated in software startups that adopt the Lean Startup approach. To make the best of agile practices, it is necessary to first understand whether and how they are used in software startups. This study targets at a better understanding of the use of agile practices in software startups, with a particular focus on lean startups. Based on a large survey of 1526 software startups, we examined the use of five agile practices, including quality related (regular refactoring and test first), speed related (frequent release and agile planning) and communication practice (daily standup meeting). The findings show that speed related agile practices are used to a greater extent in comparison to quality practices. Daily standup meeting is least used. Software startups who adopt the Lean Startup approach do not sacrifice quality for speed more than other startups do.",

	abstract="To find a fast-track to profitability, a startup needs to streamline and speed up two vital processes -- developing novel products and finding new markets for their products. These two goals are typically opposed to each other, business development requiring quick iteration and product development requiring focus on quality. This difference in mindsets, where the focus should be on the balance of quality to the business experimentation causes a conflicting environment for the developers to develop products. This problem is aggravated in a startup environment, where the reasons for product failure are not clear, increasing the frustrations felt by the developers. Clear ways to communicate the product goals and even successes between management and developers is needed to create an environment for success. This balancing act between quality and speed to achieve fast product iteration is the developers dilemma.",

	abstract="Fierce competition in the software market forces companies to release their product under tough time constraints. The competition makes companies reactive and they need to release new versions often. To achieve this need for speed, companies take shortcuts to reach deadlines. These shortcuts and resulting omitted quality are called technical debt. We investigated one middle-size Finnish software company with two independent product lines and interviewed 12 persons in different positions to understand the causes and effects of technical debt. We were also interested in specific strategies and practices for managing technical debt. The results showed that technical debt is mostly formed as a result of intentional decisions made during the project to reach deadlines. Customer satisfaction was identified as the main reason for taking technical debt in short-term but it turned to economic consequences and quality issues in the longer perspective. Interestingly, neither of the product lines had any specific management plan for reducing technical debt but several practices have been identified.",

As prototyping is an inevitable part of learning for early stage software startups, how fast startups can learn depends on how fast they can prototype. Despite of the importance, there is a lack of research about prototyping in software startups. In this study, we aimed at understanding what are factors influencing different types of prototyping activities. We conducted a multiple case study on twenty European software startups. The results are two folds; firstly we propose a prototype-centric learning model in early stage software startups. Secondly, we identify factors occur as barriers but also facilitators for prototyping in early stage software startups. The factors are grouped into (1) artifacts, (2) team competence, (3) collaboration, (4) customer and (5) process dimensions. To speed up a startup's progress at the early stage, it is important to incorporate the learning objective into a well-defined collaborative approach of prototyping.",

abstract = {Technical Debt (TD) refers to suboptimal technical solutions for expediting software development in the short term, but entails extra work in future. Although TD provides opportunities for startups (e.g., to cope with limited resources, faster time to market), it can have some negative impacts throughout the startup evolution. While previous studies have investigated the effects of TD, there is little understanding of the conditions under which TD effects can surface. In this paper, we conducted a multiple case study to explore the effects of TD incurred in the early startup stage, and when these effects are felt later in the evolution of the startup. First, we interviewed 17 participants (6 CTO/CEO founders, and 11 developers) from five software startups. In addition, we analyzed public documents related to the five software startups. Based on the results, we identified six TD effects, along with the time (i.e., the startup evolution stage) and the conditions under which they are felt by software startup teams. Our results can help startup teams to understand not just the TD effects, but also when they are likely to surface and their relationship to customer dissatisfaction.},

	abstract="In the context of software startups, project failure is embraced actively and considered crucial to obtain validated learning that can lead to pivots. A pivot is the strategic change of a business concept, product or the different elements of a business model. A better understanding is needed on different types of pivots and different factors that lead to failures and trigger pivots, for software entrepreneurial teams to make better decisions under chaotic and unpredictable environment. Due to the nascent nature of the topic, the existing research and knowledge on the pivots of software startups are very limited. In this study, we aimed at identifying the major types of pivots that software startups make during their startup processes, and highlighting the factors that fail software projects and trigger pivots. To achieve this, we conducted a case survey study based on the secondary data of the major pivots happened in 49 software startups. 10 pivot types and 14 triggering factors were identified. The findings show that customer need pivot is the most common among all pivot types. Together with customer segment pivot, they are common market related pivots. The major product related pivots are zoom-in and technology pivots. Several new pivot types were identified, including market zoom-in, complete and side project pivots. Our study also demonstrates that negative customer reaction and flawed business model are the most common factors that trigger pivots in software startups. Our study extends the research knowledge on software startup pivot types and pivot triggering factors. Meanwhile it provides practical knowledge to software startups, which they can utilize to guide their effective decisions on pivoting.",

abstract = {Context
Pricing is an essential element of software business strategy and tactics. Informed pricing decision-making requires the involvement of different stakeholders and comprehensive data analysis. Achieving both appears to be challenging, and pricing remains one of the most under-managed processes in the software business. Simultaneously, a coherent SaaS pricing body of knowledge and verified solutions to assist SaaS providers while designing and implementing pricing are missing.
Objective
There is a lack of integration among different research areas focused on SaaS pricing and, more importantly, between academia and industry. The primary aim of this paper is to clarify this misconception by classifying, thematically analyzing, and putting in correspondent academic state-of-the-art and industrial state-of-the-practice of SaaS pricing.
Method
A multivocal literature review (MLR) approach was used for the study, exploring both “white” literature as well as “grey” literature. The body of literature of 387 bibliography items was collected using a formal protocol. Of these, 57 were white literature items, and 330 were grey. A multistage content analysis process was implemented to classify the rich literature body across multiple dimensions with further mapping, synthesis, and reporting.
Results
A taxonomy of pricing-related concepts was created. It classifies SaaS pricing aspects, affecting factors, and challenges facing SaaS providers. The findings and interpretations are summarized to emphasize the major research themes and practical challenges of SaaS pricing practices’ transformation and provide further research guidelines in this area.
Conclusion
SaaS pricing is a maturing and prominent area of research that requires further investigation. The conducted MLR formed a clear picture of SaaS pricing research and practice and identified different SaaS pricing aspects and affecting factors. The study will enable both scholars and practitioners to assess the current state-of-the-art in research and practice.}

abstract = {Context
A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts, videos and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results.
Objective
There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE.
Method
To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example.
Results
The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations.
Conclusion
Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.}

	Abstract	= "Sales, profits, and success are the goals of any business, large or small. Many factors can influence success, but when software development is an important business constituent, the relationship between the software product's characteristics and business goals is strong. We don't always recognize this, of course, because most of us became engineers for nobler reasons than serving a business - the intellectual challenge, the free T-shirts, the 2 a.m. beer and pizza to celebrate unit tests that are finally passing. But ultimately we must allow the choices we make in software development to be influenced by business goals, or else risk business failure",

abstract = {Abstract This article uses system dynamics simulation to enhance current understanding of the effects of product development lead time improvement in situations where a software company itself is not able to finance its operations with its own cash flow. In these situations, capital markets will provide some rounds of financing for startup at the very beginning, but after a while the company itself should be able to enlarge its operations with its own operational cash flow. However, the delay in the product development process, as well as the decline of R\&D productivity within the final product markets, will have their effects. On the basis of the results of this article, it is suggested that the improvement of product development lead time is one of the most important parameters in the software startup environment. In some situations, not only will slightly improved lead time performance require fewer rounds of financing, but also expansion of the company's operations will become less troublesome.
