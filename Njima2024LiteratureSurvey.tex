\begin{abstract}
 Startups often operate under limited resources and time, and may intentionally accumulate technical debt to meet immediate market needs.
 However, this intentional accumulation requires careful management to avoid long-term negative consequences for the startup.
 We conducted a Multivocal Literature Review of the existing body of knowledge in order to understand the state of the art and the practice
 of technical debt in startups and its implications. The key outcome of this study is the creation of a framework that provides a
 comprehensive view of technical debt in startups including it's dimensions and attributes as well as a taxonomy that describes the
 different forms it takes and directions for future work.
